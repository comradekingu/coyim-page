# Release notes for CoyIM 0.3.1

The 0.3.1 release is a bug fix release that fixes a crash that happens if you have no proxies defined. In general, this happens most likely if you have manually removed proxies, or if you have imported accounts from another client that wasn't set up to use Tor. If you did the latter, make sure to check the proxy settings and add an Automatic Tor proxy in order to protect yourself.
