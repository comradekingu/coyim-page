# Release notes for CoyIM 0.3.5

We are very proud to release CoyIM 0.3.5!

This lovely release once again includes the OS X DMGs - sorry for the trouble.

New features:

- Make it possible to configure whether empty groups should be displayed or not

Bug fixes:

- \#288 - When removing a group association, that should actually be visible in the UI
- \#318 - Only set urgency hint when new messages have come in
- Fix the OS X build
