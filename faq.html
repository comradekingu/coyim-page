    <label for="toggle_1"><h3>How is this application secure?</h3></label>
    <div id="expand_1">
      <p>CoyIM is a standalone chat client with a focus on safety and security. It has built-in support for Tor, OTR and TLS. The Tor support allows users to become anonymous when chatting. OTR makes end-to-end encryption of communication possible. And TLS adds another layer of encryption for communication with chat servers. These features are core parts of the application: they are not plugins or extras in any way.</p>

     <input id="toggle_2" type="checkbox" checked>
      <label for="toggle_2"><h3>Why is this better than other apps?</h3></label>
        <div id="expand_2">
          <p>CoyIM is safe from the moment you start it up. It is possible to just start using the application and use it in the right way. In some cases you can turn off the safe defaults, but you will not have to configure anything extra to get all the protection we can give you.</p>

     <label for="toggle_4"><h3>What does it mean 'not yet audited'?</h3></label>
        <div id="expand_4">
          'Not yeat audited' means that CoyIm is still under active development. There have been no security audits of the code, and you should not currently use this for anything sensitive.
